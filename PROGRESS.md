# SpaceTraders UI Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the SpaceTraders UI application following the workplan outlined in WORKPLAN.md and ShipAutomation.md.

## Current Status: Milestone M1 - COMPLETED âœ…

### What Has Been Implemented

#### âœ… Project Setup
- React application with Vite build system
- TypeScript for type safety

- Modern toolchain with hot reloading

#### âœ… API Client
- SpaceTradersAPI class with proper rate limiting (2 req/second max)
- Token management system supporting both Account and Agent tokens
- Error handling and retry logic
- RESTful API integration following SpaceTraders v2 API

#### âœ… Dashboard (Basic)
- Agent information display (credits, headquarters, faction, ship count)
- Fleet overview showing all ships
- Ship status indicators (docked, in orbit, in transit)
- Basic ship actions (dock, orbit, refuel)

#### âœ… Token Management
- Secure local storage of tokens
- Support for multiple agents
- Account token and agent token separation
- Token validation workflow

#### âœ… Core Components
- `AgentInfo`: Displays agent statistics and information
- `ShipCard`: Shows ship details with action buttons
- `TokenSetup`: Handles initial agent token configuration
- `Dashboard`: Main screen combining all components

#### âœ… Infrastructure
- Cross-platform storage abstraction
- Rate limiter respecting SpaceTraders API limits
- Error handling and user feedback
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

```

### Features Demonstrated

1. **Token Authentication**: Users can enter their SpaceTraders agent token
2. **Agent Dashboard**: Real-time display of agent information and credits
3. **Fleet Management**: View all ships with current status
4. **Basic Ship Operations**: Dock, orbit, and refuel ships
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors with user feedback
6. **Rate Limiting**: Respects SpaceTraders API limits
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile browsers

## Technical Notes

### API Integration
- Successfully integrated with SpaceTraders v2.3.0 API
- Implements proper rate limiting (max 2 requests/second)
- Handles authentication with Bearer tokens
- Error responses are properly parsed and displayed

### Storage Strategy
- Uses localStorage for web platform
- Token storage with JSON serialization
- Ready for AsyncStorage integration for React Native
- Supports multiple agent token management

### Performance Considerations
- Rate limiter prevents API quota violations
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Minimal API calls with smart caching potential
- Responsive design optimized for various screen sizes

### Security
- Tokens stored securely in local storage
- API tokens are properly redacted in logs
- HTTPS-only API communication
- Input validation and sanitization

## Next Steps

1. **Priority**: Implement M2 (Contracts & Navigation)
   - Add contracts listing screen
   - Create basic map visualization
   - Implement ship navigation commands

2. **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing
   - Unit tests for API client
   - Component tests for UI elements
   - Integration tests for workflows

3. **Documentation**: Expand user documentation
   - Getting started guide
   - API usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Conclusion

Milestone M1 has been successfully completed with a working React application that demonstrates:
- Token management and authentication
- Basic agent and fleet dashboard
