### Features Demonstrated

1. **Token Authentication**: Users can enter their SpaceTraders agent token
2. **Multi-Screen Navigation**: Tab-based navigation between Dashboard, Contracts, and Map
3. **Agent Dashboard**: Real-time display of agent information and credits
4. **Fleet Management**: View all ships with current status
5. **Basic Ship Operations**: Dock, orbit, and refuel ships
6. **Contracts Management**: View, filter, and accept available contracts
7. **Interactive Map**: Navigate ships between waypoints with fuel cost calculation
8. **Route Planning**: Distance calculation and fuel requirements for navigation
9. **Contract Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators for delivery requirements
10. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors with user feedback
11. **Rate Limiting**: Respects SpaceTraders API limits
12. **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile browsers
